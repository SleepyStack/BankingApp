TODO: For ACCOUNTS
Validation: Add validation annotations to models and/or use Spring's validation framework in controllers.
DTOs: Use Data Transfer Objects for requests and responses to avoid exposing internal entities directly.
Error Handling: Implement a global exception handler to return user-friendly error messages.
Security: Add authentication and authorization to restrict account access to the rightful user.
Status & Auditing: Add fields for status (active, closed, etc.), and timestamps for creation and update.
Transaction Safety: For balance updates, consider using transactions to avoid race conditions.
Pagination: Add pagination to listing endpoints for scalability.
Documentation: Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for endpoints.
Account Number Uniqueness: Consider adding database-level unique constraints if possible.

TODO for API Abstraction and URL Improvements

- [ ] Refactor User endpoints to use `publicIdentifier` (instead of MongoDB `_id`)
  - Update UserController to accept `publicIdentifier` in all routes
  - Update UserService and UserRepository to query by `publicIdentifier`
  - Example: `/users/{publicIdentifier}`

- [ ] Refactor AccountType endpoints to use `publicIdentifier`
  - Update AccountTypeController to use `publicIdentifier` in all routes
  - Update AccountTypeService and AccountTypeRepository accordingly
  - Example: `/account-types/{publicIdentifier}`

- [ ] Refactor Transaction endpoints to use account numbers and user public IDs instead of internal IDs
  - Update TransactionController to accept account numbers and user public IDs in all transaction-related routes
  - Update TransactionService to resolve public-facing IDs to internal IDs before processing
  - Example: `/users/{userPublicId}/accounts/{accountNumber}/transactions/deposit`

- [ ] Add helper methods in services to resolve `publicIdentifier` or account number to internal IDs

- [ ] Update any documentation or API specs to reflect new URL structure

- [ ] Test all endpoints after refactoring to ensure old and new logic works as expected
